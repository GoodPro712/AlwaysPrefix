Always a Prefix makes every item you obtain to choose the prefix you selected in the mod config instead of a randomized value.
YOU HAVE TO SET A VALUE IN THE MOD'S CONFIG OR ELSE THIS MOD WON't DO ANYTHING
Navigate to the mod config via Mods > find Always a Prefix > Press the config button (a gear with a wrench)
